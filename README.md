# Description Of Application:
This site is a Weather Dashboard , that allows the user to input any city and be presented with the city name, date, an emoji representing the current weather condition, and the temperature, humidity, and windspeed.

Below that, the user is presented with a 5-day forecast for that city, with the same elements displayed for each of the five days.

As the user searches for additional cities, the past city searches are listed on the left of the screen, below the input box. The past cities in the list can be clicked on to open the current weather and 5-day forecast again, and will persist in the list upon refresh of the browser.
